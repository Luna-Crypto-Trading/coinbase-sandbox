# Coinbase API Consolidation Summary

## Overview
All Coinbase functionality has been consolidated into the `AdvancedTradeController` to match the real Coinbase Advanced Trade API structure exactly. This ensures that sandbox users only need to change their base URL and not modify any application logic.

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Consolidated Controllers
All Coinbase-related functionality is now under `/api/v3/brokerage/*` endpoints in the `AdvancedTradeController`:

#### Products (Passthrough to Real API)
- `GET /api/v3/brokerage/products` - List all products
- `GET /api/v3/brokerage/products/{product_id}` - Get specific product
- `GET /api/v3/brokerage/products/{product_id}/candles` - Get product candles
- `GET /api/v3/brokerage/products/{product_id}/ticker` - Get product ticker
- `GET /api/v3/brokerage/products/{product_id}/book` - Get order book
- `GET /api/v3/brokerage/best_bid_ask` - Get best bid/ask prices

#### Orders (Mock Implementation)
- `POST /api/v3/brokerage/orders` - Create order
- `GET /api/v3/brokerage/orders/historical` - List orders
- `GET /api/v3/brokerage/orders/historical/{order_id}` - Get specific order
- `DELETE /api/v3/brokerage/orders/{order_id}` - Cancel single order
- `POST /api/v3/brokerage/orders/batch_cancel` - Cancel multiple orders

#### Accounts (Mock Implementation)
- `GET /api/v3/brokerage/accounts` - List accounts
- `GET /api/v3/brokerage/accounts/{account_id}` - Get specific account

#### Sandbox-Specific Endpoints
- `POST /api/v3/brokerage/sandbox/prices/{product_id}` - Set mock price
- `POST /api/v3/brokerage/sandbox/accounts/{account_id}/deposit` - Deposit funds
- `POST /api/v3/brokerage/sandbox/accounts/{account_id}/withdraw` - Withdraw funds

### üóëÔ∏è Removed Controllers
The following controllers were removed as their functionality is now consolidated:

1. **OrdersController.cs** - Functionality moved to `/api/v3/brokerage/orders/*`
2. **WalletsController.cs** - Functionality moved to `/api/v3/brokerage/accounts/*`
3. **ProductsController.cs** - Functionality already existed in `/api/v3/brokerage/products/*`
4. **PricesController.cs** - Sandbox pricing moved to `/api/v3/brokerage/sandbox/prices/*`
5. **CoinbasePassthroughController.cs** - Redundant with AdvancedTradeController

### üîÑ Preserved Controllers
These controllers remain as they provide non-Coinbase functionality:

- **AdvancedTradeController.cs** - Main Coinbase API compatibility
- **SandboxController.cs** - Sandbox management features
- **TechnicalAnalysisController.cs** - Technical analysis tools
- **BacktestController.cs** - Backtesting functionality
- **DashboardController.cs** - Dashboard features
- **NotificationsController.cs** - Notification system

## Benefits

### üéØ Perfect API Compatibility
- **Before**: Users needed to modify their application logic to use different endpoints
- **After**: Users only need to change the base URL from `https://api.coinbase.com` to `https://your-sandbox-url.com`

### üìö Real Coinbase API Structure
All endpoints now match the official Coinbase Advanced Trade API:
```
Real Coinbase API:     https://api.coinbase.com/api/v3/brokerage/orders
Sandbox API:          https://your-sandbox.com/api/v3/brokerage/orders
```

### üîß Easy Integration
Existing Coinbase client libraries will work without modification:
- Python: `coinbase-advanced-py`
- Node.js: `coinbase-advanced-node`
- .NET: `Coinbase.AdvancedTrade`
- Any HTTP client using the official API

### üß™ Enhanced Testing
- Real market data passthrough for products and pricing
- Mock order execution and account management
- Sandbox-specific endpoints for testing scenarios

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Before: Users had to change endpoint paths
var client = new CoinbaseClient("https://your-sandbox.com");
await client.GetAsync("/api/orders"); // Wrong path

// After: Users only change the base URL
var client = new CoinbaseClient("https://your-sandbox.com"); // Only change this
await client.GetAsync("/api/v3/brokerage/orders"); // Same path as real API
```

## Migration Guide

For existing sandbox users:

1. **Update base URL only**: Change from real Coinbase API URL to sandbox URL
2. **Keep all endpoint paths**: No changes needed to `/api/v3/brokerage/*` paths
3. **Use same authentication**: CB-ACCESS headers or Bearer tokens work the same
4. **Leverage sandbox features**: Use `/sandbox/*` endpoints for testing scenarios

This consolidation ensures seamless compatibility with the real Coinbase Advanced Trade API while providing powerful sandbox testing capabilities.
